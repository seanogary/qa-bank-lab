# LEARNING GUIDE: pytest Configuration File
# This file configures pytest behavior for the backend test suite
# LEARNING: Configuration files help maintain consistent testing standards across teams
# SUGGESTION: Customize these settings based on your project requirements

# Directory where pytest looks for test files

# Test discovery patterns - look for tests in all subdirectories

# LEARNING: Command-line options for pytest (verbose, short traceback, strict marker usage)
# SUGGESTION: Add --cov=backend for code coverage reports
# SUGGESTION: Add --html=report.html for HTML test reports
addopts = -v --tb=short --strict-markers
# LEARNING: Custom markers for categorizing tests
# SUGGESTION: Use @pytest.mark.unit for fast, isolated tests
# SUGGESTION: Use @pytest.mark.integration for tests requiring external dependencies
# SUGGESTION: Use @pytest.mark.api for endpoint testing
# SUGGESTION: Use @pytest.mark.slow for tests that take longer to run
